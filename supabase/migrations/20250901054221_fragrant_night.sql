  # Add comprehensive page content management

  1. New Tables
    - `page_content`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `page_name` (text, unique) - identifies which page (home, about, lore, etc.)
      - `section_key` (text) - identifies which section of the page
      - `content` (jsonb) - flexible content storage
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
      - `updated_at` (timestamp)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `page_content` table
    - Add policy for authenticated users to manage content
    - Add policy for public users to read content

  3. Initial Data
    - Populate with default content for all pages
